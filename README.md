# Youtube-Shuffler
By Ben Osborn

A simple desktop app which allows users to listen to their playlists on shuffle mode without hearing the same song.

This app was built one night after I listened to the same song in my Youtube playlist 4 times within a single hour! This has not been an uncommon occurance when using Youtube playlists so I decided to write this app which would allow me to watch every single video in the playlist before seeing a repeat. It also allows users to add multiple playlists to the queue.

It is built using Python, Selenium, Tkinter.
